Depict a Japanese village or town during dusk, where warm, fiery reds from the setting sun contrast with deep blues of the evening sky. Show traditional wooden structures, slightly worn with age, as flickering embers float through the air, hinting at the aftermath of a battle. The environment feels intense and charged, yet quiet, capturing the stillness just after a dramatic event. Avoid including characters, but focus on the dramatic lighting, architectural details, and atmospheric tension. dont forget to mention the anime style names at the beginning";
